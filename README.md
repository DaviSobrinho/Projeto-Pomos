# Projeto-Pomos

I made this project named POMOS during my 2Â° semester of ADS in UCB, it consists in a CRUD of tasks that you can apply the pomodoro technique, you can mark them and save them with name, description, time to do, time to rest and priority.
The app contains a timer and you can use the timer to apply the pomodoro technique once it has built-in alerts that helps you to control your time and focus while doing the currently task.

Below you can watch an example of Pomos use in PT_BR:
